Getting started with IceStorm
-----------------------------

Nothing to see here, this is mostly my personal playground to get started
with [icestorm] and not useful in any other way.

`make` generates the bitstream that then can be flashed to the [iCEstick].
Depending on the USB permissions, the flash-step might require root access.

```
make
sudo make flash
```
